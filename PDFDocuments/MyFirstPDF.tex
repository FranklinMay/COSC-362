\maketitle

The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog, and other things I learned today.

\begin{enumerate}
\item We looked at using shh with ''X'' Tunneling
\begin{verbatim}
ssh -X <username>@savage.nsm.iup.edu
\end{verbatim}
This allowed for windowed graphics to be viewed on the rempote machine.
\item I also used ''evince'' as a viewer to open the remote documents.


\end{enumerate}

"This looks dorky in \LaTeX\ !"
\section*{Some stuff the language does}
If you have some math:
\[ \sum_{i=0}^{100} f(x_i) \approx \int_{\Omega} f(x) \, dx \]

Then typesetting is easy.
